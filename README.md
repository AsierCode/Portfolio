## üöÄ Getting Started (General Guide)

This project is set up as a standard React application. To run it locally:

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
    ```bash
    # git clone <repository-url>
    # cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set up Environment Variables (if any):**
    If the project requires an API key (e.g., for a future Gemini API integration), you would typically create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your key:
    ```env
    # .env file
    # API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY 
    ```
    *(Currently, the API key is mentioned as `process.env.API_KEY` in guidelines but not actively used in the provided code for display purposes. This step is for future reference if API integration is added.)*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    This will usually start the application on `http://localhost:3000` or a similar port.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Production

To create an optimized build for deployment:
```bash
npm run build
# or
# yarn build
```
This will typically create a `dist` or `build` folder with the static assets.
